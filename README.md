# ReadMe-Generator-

##Description
The reason for this project was to help generate README files much faster and more efficiently allowing me to spend less time having to go through and physically write everything. While working on this project there were a lot of things that came up. Two big problems I had to figure out was the write file. I could not get the write file to work so I went in forums and found out I needed to use writeFileSync and writetofile. If I used writeFile then it wasnt working giving errors in terminal.  Also trying to figure out how to get the renderlicense badges and the license link to pull up with all sorts of different articles to said license. I found one link that gave the information for all types of licences so decided to move forward with that link.
